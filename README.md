# express-locallibrary-tutorial

Created using the tutorial from:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/skeleton_website

Live deployment at:
https://express-locallibrary-tutorial-webservice.onrender.com

Render.com settings:
Runtime: Node
Build command: npm install
Start command: npm start
and add the data base connection key and string

To get it to deploy successfully I had to re-run 'npm install mongoose' and 'npm install express-async-handler'. Not sure why.
